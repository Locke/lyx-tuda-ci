LyX layout files for [tuda-ci](https://ctan.org/pkg/tuda-ci).

### Installation

You must have `tuda-ci` (classes, fonts and icon) set up, see [LaTeX@TUDa](https://www.ce.tu-darmstadt.de/ce/latex_tuda/index.de.jsp).

Copy the layouts files from the `layouts` folder into your LyX `layouts` folder (e.g. in your [user directory](http://wiki.lyx.org/LyX/UserDir)), then reconfigure LyX (Tools -> Reconfigure) and restart it. You should now be able to select the Document Class under Document -> Settings...

You can find example LyX files for all layouts in the `examples` folder.

### Status

Right now, only the `TUDa-CI Pub` class is available as LyX layout. I intend to work on the other classes from time to time.
